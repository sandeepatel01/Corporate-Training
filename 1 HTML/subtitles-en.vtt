Welcome to the tutorial.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
In this video, we will learn how to add subtitles.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Adding subtitles improves accessibility for everyone.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Let’s start with the basic HTML structure.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Then we’ll add subtitles using the <track> tag.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Make sure the subtitles file is in .vtt format.

00:00:50.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Test your subtitles to ensure they align with the video.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:12.000
